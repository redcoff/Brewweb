# BrewWeb
This project is a submission for [B6B39ZWA Foundations of Web Applications](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/education/bk/predmety/31/29/p3129506.html) at Czech Technical University in Prague for the year 2018/2019.
For more information about implementation, see [Zpracování BrewWeb](https://github.com/redcoff/Brewweb/blob/master/Zpracov%C3%A1n%C3%AD%20BrewWeb.docx) (Czech language only).

## Topic
BrewWeb is a webpage about the concept of drip coffee. It contains information about dripped coffee, alternative methods to brew it and find cafés where the drip coffee is served. The first idea of creating this page was that alternative ways of making coffee are not so expanded among coffee lovers. This application should introduce a deeper coffee world and show the beauty of making coffee differently than only pouring instant coffee into a mug. The webpage contains an interactive map and the option to add pins as a registered user.

## Content
The web application contains five pages;
* Home: the main home page that describes brief information about the webpage with a redirect button to the Coffee Alternative methods page.
* Coffee Alternative methods: Information page about drip coffee, history and methods.
* Café map: World map focused on Prague. Each café added by admin or users is pinned into the map.
* Contact: Information about web creator and contact.
* Login page, with user registration.

## Technology
The webpage was created 
* using multiplatform IDE [JetBrains PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).
* in HTML, Javascript and PHP.
* using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
* using Windows web software package [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/).
* with [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [MySQL database server](https://www.mysql.com/) and [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/).
* using open-source JavaScript library with mobile-friendly compatibility of interactive map [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
